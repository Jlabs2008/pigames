Let pi play a game!

# How does this work?
Well, what it does is bind a keypress to a digit of pi. All you have to do is run it, then open the game of choice super quickly and let pi do the rest! Note, we are not responsible for pi accedently buying a copy of a random steam game because you decided to leave the program running. You know who you are.

# How do you run it?
First you need to install the nesisary libraries, Keyboard, then run the code in any modern instance of python!
